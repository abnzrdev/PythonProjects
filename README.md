# 100 Days of Python — Project Index

This repository collects my projects and exercises from the "100 Days of Python" challenge. Below is a concise inventory of the main folders and notable projects so you can quickly find and run them.

- **Repository:** : 100DaysOfPython — assorted drills, mini-projects, and exercises.

**Top-level items**
- **`Calculator/`**: Small calculator and tokenizer experiments. Entry: `Calculator/main.py`.
- **`DailyDrills/`**: Day-by-day practice projects (organized by Day##). Many playable games and exercises live here.
- **`list.py`**: Miscellaneous helper / scratch script.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

**Highlights inside `DailyDrills/`**
- **`Day16/CoffeeMachineOOP/`**: `coffee_maker.py`, `menu.py`, `money_machine.py` — object-oriented coffee machine simulation.
- **`Day24/MailMerger/`**: A small mail-merge demo under `mailmerge/main.py` and input files under `mailmerge/Input/`.
- **`Day24/SnakeGameModified/`**: Modified Snake game with `main.py`, `snake.py`, `scoreboard.py`.
- **`Day25/USStates/`**: `50_states.csv` and `main.py` — US states learning exercise.
- **`Day26/NATO/`**: `main.py` with `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` and `test_main.py` for unit tests.
- **`Day20/`**, **`Day22/`**: Basic games using `turtle` (snake, ball, bar, etc.).

If you want a deeper map, I can generate a full per-day file list or link to each `main.py`.

**Quick run examples**
Run most small scripts from the repo root using Python 3, for example:

```bash
python3 Calculator/main.py
python3 DailyDrills/Day16/CoffeeMachineOOP/main.py
python3 DailyDrills/Day24/SnakeGameModified/main.py
python3 DailyDrills/Day26/NATO/main.py
```

Notes:
- Many exercises are small scripts intended to be run directly (no external dependencies).
- Some projects use `turtle` or other interactive modules; run them in a GUI-enabled environment.
